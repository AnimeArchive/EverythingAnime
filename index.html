            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>This site is for all you degenerates out there who can't get enough of existing anime girls.</p>
            <p>
                It mainly focuses on collecting all different custom anime models out there and some that are my own,
                that is free to use for everyone. Anime image generation has become so popular, but <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a> has
                made it even more popular. Even though its popularity exploded, the models were difficult to find for me as it
                is scattered across Discord servers, Reddit communities, and HuggingFace repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am sure that there are going to be other people who is experiencing the same problems as well, which
                is why I made this site. I hope you enjoy, and get to find some anime girls you will like.
